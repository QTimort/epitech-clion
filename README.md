# epitech-clion
Epitech norm compliant configuration for CLion IDE.<br />
This CLion configuration is made to be as compliant as possible with the Epitech norm.<br />
If you have any suggestion please let me know.<br />

# Installation

**Code Style**<br />
*file -> settings -> code style -> manage... -> import*
- Import "Epitech C 2018.xml"

**Epitech Header**<br />
*file -> settings -> code style -> File and Code Templates -> Includes*
- Add an include named "C Epitech Header" with extension 'h' and paste the content of Header_Template.txt in the large field.<br />
- Replace the promo variable set by default to "2022" to your year of promo.<br />

*file -> settings -> code style -> File and Code Templates -> Files*<br />
-> C Source File replace "C File Header.h" by "C Epitech Header.h"<br />
-> C Header File replace "C File Header.h" by "C Epitech Header.h"<br />

# Known problems:
- When creating a new project, the default main generated doesn't have the epitech header, you have to copy paste it manually.

# Warning
- The number of line in a function, line breaks != number of lines, more exactly 19 line breaks = 20 lines.
- When including the first include in a file, check that CLion didnt put the include before the Epitech Header.

# Old Installation

**Code Style**<br />
*file -> settings -> code style -> manage... -> import*
- Import "Epitech_C_old.xml"

**Epitech Header**<br />
*file -> settings -> code style -> File and Code Templates -> Includes*
- Add an include for c/h Extension and paste the content of Header_Template_old.txt in it.
- Replace 'nom' and 'prenom' with yours.

# Old Known problem:
- When reformating the file, variable and function aren't aligned together, you have to do it manually.
- The header is semi-hard coded since there isn't a "PATH" variable and the last modified field isn't updated. (but it shouldn't affect the norm)
- When creating a new project, the default main generated doesn't have the epitech header, you have to copy paste it manually.
- Be carefull when declaring a variable and a function, Clion automatically put a space instead of a tab, you have to fix it manually.
